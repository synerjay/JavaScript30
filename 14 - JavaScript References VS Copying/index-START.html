      let name = 'Jerome';
      let name1 = name;
      name = 'Jack';
      console.log(name1, name); // With strings, original variable will not be mutated

      let number = 7;
      let number2 = number;
      number = 9;
      console.log(number2, number);
      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      players[3] = 'Lux';
      console.log(team); // Since players array was mutated, team array was also mutated because team was only making a reference to it

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // We make a copy by using slice();
      const team2 = players.slice(); // this will make a copy and not a reference
      players[3] = 'Change!';
      console.log(players); // index 3 is Change!
      console.log(team2); // index 3 stays the same "Lux"
      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      players[3] = 'Concat? You have no match for me!';
      console.log(team3);
      console.log(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team4 = [...players]; // will make a copy and it is very popular in redex operations
      players[3] = 'Spread? You have no match for me';
      console.log(team4);
      console.log(players);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      players[3] = 'Array from? You have no match for me!';
      console.log(team5);
      console.log(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person; // this is only making a reference and not an exact copy!!!
      captain.number = 99;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      //We use Object.assign method!
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      // take in an empty object, the object itself, and the third argument takes in an object of new values to the keys
      console.log(cap2);
      // WARNING: this method is only a SHALLOW copy meaning, it will only make a copy ONE level DEEP. Any deeper will mutate the original copy

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const cap3 = {...person}  <-- not yet available!

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: '@Wesbos',
          facebook: 'wesbos.developer',
        },
      };
      console.clear();

      // make a copy

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // it will only make a SHALLOW Copy!!

      // To make a clone deep, search clone deep object

      // There's still another way though ....

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

      // Performance-wise, this way might not be a good idea
